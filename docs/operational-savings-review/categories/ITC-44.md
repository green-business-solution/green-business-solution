# Information Card — Compressed Air Controls

**Retrofits included:** Compressed air controls

**Overview:** Improved compressor controls reduce input power across the annual load profile while preserving flow and pressure requirements.

**Broader Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings =
Annual Electricity Reduction × Bill-Derived Electricity Rate
```

**Expanded Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings = In-Scope Equipment Count × Sum Across Load Bins of Annual Hours in Each Load Bin × (Existing Input Power in Each Load Bin - Proposed Input Power in Each Load Bin) × Bill-Derived Electricity Rate

MEASUR resolves input kW from compressor type, control mode, pressure, and load fraction.
```

**■ Standard 1.1 — Compressed Air Controls Engineering Calculation**

**Purpose:**
Use U.S. Department of Energy - MEASUR to resolve existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings from the listed category inputs.

**Lookup Inputs:**

* In-Scope Equipment Count
* Compressor type
* Rated input power
* Rated flow
* Existing control mode
* Proposed control mode
* Load fraction for each bin
* Annual hours for each bin

**Value Needed:**

* Existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings

**How to Use:**

1. Validate these inputs and preserve the source of each supplied value: In-Scope Equipment Count; Compressor type; Rated input power.
2. Map the supplied project facts and units to the named calculator, run the versioned open-source calculation locally, reject incomplete or incompatible inputs, and return its existing and proposed resource results.
3. Reject missing, ambiguous, incompatible, or out-of-scope records instead of inserting a generic default.
4. Return existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings.
5. Store the source version, selected record or method, input units, and any warnings with the result.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Pinned local execution of the exact MEASUR calculator for this category.
* **Automation Method:** Map the supplied project facts and units to the named calculator, run the versioned open-source calculation locally, reject incomplete or incompatible inputs, and return its existing and proposed resource results.
* **Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

**Validation:**
The official MEASUR tool page, calculator descriptions, and open-source implementation were checked, so local automation is feasible. The exact category module, input and output mapping, and golden example have not yet been pinned, so this process must not imply executable validation.
