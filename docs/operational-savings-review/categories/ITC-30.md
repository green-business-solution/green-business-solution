# Information Card — Electric Forklift or Material Handling Equipment

**Retrofits included:** Electric forklift / material handling equipment

**Overview:** Electric material-handling equipment replaces hourly fuel use with charging electricity for the same operating duty.

**Broader Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings =
Annual Resource Reduction × Applicable Bill-Derived Resource Rate
```

**Expanded Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings = In-Scope Equipment Count × Annual Operating Hours × (Existing Fuel Per Hour × Current Fuel Price - Proposed kWh Per Hour × Bill-Derived Electricity Rate)
```

**■ Standard 1.1 — Electric Forklift or Material Handling Equipment Annual Operating Hours**

**Purpose:**
Use U.S. Department of Energy reference buildings and U.S. Naval Observatory daylight data to resolve annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
U.S. Department of Energy - Commercial Reference Buildings

**Commercial Reference Buildings:**
[https://www.energy.gov/cmei/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings](https://www.energy.gov/cmei/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* Recognizable Business, Shift, Seasonal, or Usage Pattern
* Detailed Operating Days, Shifts, or Active Season, if known
* Measured Annual Operating Hours, if known
* Site Location and Business Activity

**Value Needed:**

* Annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance

**How to Use:**

1. Map the Electric Forklift or Material Handling Equipment inputs to the documented Electric Forklift or Material Handling Equipment Annual Operating Hours source fields or model inputs: Recognizable Business, Shift, Seasonal, or Usage Pattern; Detailed Operating Days, Shifts, or Active Season, if known; Measured Annual Operating Hours, if known; Site Location and Business Activity.
2. Route the stated pattern to a fixed-schedule or daylight method, apply all supplied days and seasonal details, validate the annual-hour result, and retain the method and analysis year.
3. When an exact value is unavailable, select one context-matched authoritative benchmark and then one deterministic RetroFi benchmark if needed; do not insert an unexplained cross-category default.
4. Return one selected annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance.
5. Retain the Electric Forklift or Material Handling Equipment Annual Operating Hours source version, exact fields or model inputs, native units, eligible population, population size, selected-value rule, fallback level, selected record, and warnings.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Deterministic calendar calculation from a recognizable business, shift, seasonal, or usage pattern.
* **Automation Method:** Apply the supplied operating days, shifts, active weeks, holidays, and measured-hour overrides to a versioned local calendar calculation.
* **Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

**Validation:**
The DOE commercial reference-building schedule context was checked. Calendar arithmetic is deterministic when the operating pattern is complete, but a business label alone is not a validated annual-hours value and no category golden fixture exists.
