# Information Card — Solar Plus Storage

**Retrofits included:** Solar-plus-storage system

**Overview:** A combined solar and battery system coordinates onsite generation, charging, discharging, imports, and exports to change the annual electric bill.

**Broader Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings =
Baseline Annual Bill − Proposed Annual Bill
```

**Expanded Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings = Baseline Annual Bill - Proposed Annual Bill

PV Annual Onsite Generation follows ITC-17 and storage state follows ITC-23 inside one dispatch optimization.
```

**■ Standard 1.1 — PVWatts Solar Production Calculation**

**Purpose:**
Use National Laboratory of the Rockies - PVWatts V8 to resolve interval or annual AC electricity generation, with model inputs, warnings, units, and source version from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
National Laboratory of the Rockies - PVWatts V8

**PVWatts V8 API documentation:**
[https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/solar/pvwatts/v8/](https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/solar/pvwatts/v8/)

**System Advisor Model repository:**
[https://github.com/NatLabRockies/SAM](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/SAM)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* DC capacity
* Module Type
* Array type
* System losses
* Tilt
* Azimuth
* Power capacity
* Usable-energy capacity

**Value Needed:**

* Interval or annual AC electricity generation, with model inputs, warnings, units, and source version

**How to Use:**

1. Validate these inputs and preserve the source of each supplied value: DC capacity; Module Type; Array type.
2. Validate site coordinates and array design, run the documented V8 field contract, check warnings, and return interval or annual AC generation with source provenance.
3. Reject missing, ambiguous, incompatible, or out-of-scope records instead of inserting a generic default.
4. Return interval or annual AC electricity generation, with model inputs, warnings, units, and source version.
5. Store the source version, selected record or method, input units, and any warnings with the result.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** PVWatts V8 API or pinned local SAM execution with the same explicit array inputs.
* **Automation Method:** Validate site coordinates and array design, run the documented V8 field contract, check warnings, and return interval or annual AC generation with source provenance.
* **Difficulty:** Medium

**Validation:**
The official V8 field contract was checked and the retained fixture validates required fields, units, source version, and unsupported defaults. The source can calculate generation but cannot choose system capacity or array configuration for the project.

**■ Standard 1.2 — Solar Plus Storage Interval Bill Calculation**

**Purpose:**
Use National Laboratory of the Rockies - REopt V3 and REopt.jl to resolve baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
National Laboratory of the Rockies - REopt V3 and REopt.jl

**REopt API V3 documentation:**
[https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt/v3/](https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt/v3/)

**REopt.jl input reference:**
[https://natlabrockies.github.io/REopt.jl/dev/reopt/inputs/](https://natlabrockies.github.io/REopt.jl/dev/reopt/inputs/)

**REopt.jl open-source package:**
[https://github.com/NatLabRockies/REopt.jl](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/REopt.jl)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* DC capacity
* Module Type
* Array type
* System losses
* Tilt
* Azimuth
* Power capacity
* Usable-energy capacity

**Value Needed:**

* Baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance

**How to Use:**

1. Validate these inputs and preserve the source of each supplied value: DC capacity; Module Type; Array type.
2. Align the interval load and tariff calendar, apply the category constraints, solve baseline and proposed cases, compare bill components, and retain solver and input provenance.
3. Reject missing, ambiguous, incompatible, or out-of-scope records instead of inserting a generic default.
4. Return baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance.
5. Store the source version, selected record or method, input units, and any warnings with the result.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Pinned local REopt.jl optimization after complete chronological load, tariff, and technology inputs pass validation.
* **Automation Method:** Align the interval load and tariff calendar, apply the category constraints, solve baseline and proposed cases, compare bill components, and retain solver and input provenance.
* **Difficulty:** Hard

**Validation:**
The official V3 input documentation and open-source solver were checked, so local optimization is technically possible. No category dispatch adapter or golden result is retained, and REopt cannot supply a missing load profile, tariff, or technology design.
