# Information Card — Managed Fleet Charging

**Retrofits included:** Fleet telematics / charging management system

**Overview:** Managed charging shifts fleet electricity use within vehicle availability windows to reduce tariff costs without missing required departure energy.

**Broader Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings =
Baseline Annual Bill − Proposed Annual Bill
```

**Expanded Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings = Unmanaged Annual Bill - Managed Annual Bill

Sum Across Available Intervals of Delivered Charging Energy in Each Interval ≥ Required Departure Energy
```

**■ Standard 1.1 — Managed Fleet Charging Interval Bill Calculation**

**Purpose:**
Use National Laboratory of the Rockies - REopt V3 and REopt.jl to resolve baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
National Laboratory of the Rockies - REopt V3 and REopt.jl

**REopt API V3 documentation:**
[https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt/v3/](https://developer.nlr.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt/v3/)

**REopt.jl input reference:**
[https://natlabrockies.github.io/REopt.jl/dev/reopt/inputs/](https://natlabrockies.github.io/REopt.jl/dev/reopt/inputs/)

**REopt.jl open-source package:**
[https://github.com/NatLabRockies/REopt.jl](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/REopt.jl)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* Timestamped Interval Electricity Data
* Time Zone and Daylight-Saving Treatment from Uploaded Interval Data
* Complete Tariff Calendar and Billing Rules
* Billing-Demand and Ratchet Rules
* Vehicle-arrival schedule
* Vehicle-departure schedule
* Required energy by departure
* Charger power limit

**Value Needed:**

* Baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance

**How to Use:**

1. Validate these inputs and preserve the source of each supplied value: Timestamped Interval Electricity Data; Time Zone and Daylight-Saving Treatment from Uploaded Interval Data; Complete Tariff Calendar and Billing Rules.
2. Align the interval load and tariff calendar, apply the category constraints, solve baseline and proposed cases, compare bill components, and retain solver and input provenance.
3. Reject missing, ambiguous, incompatible, or out-of-scope records instead of inserting a generic default.
4. Return baseline and proposed annual bills and interval dispatch results, with tariff, solver, input, and unit provenance.
5. Store the source version, selected record or method, input units, and any warnings with the result.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Pinned local REopt.jl optimization after complete chronological load, tariff, and technology inputs pass validation.
* **Automation Method:** Align the interval load and tariff calendar, apply the category constraints, solve baseline and proposed cases, compare bill components, and retain solver and input provenance.
* **Difficulty:** Hard

**Validation:**
The official V3 input documentation and open-source solver were checked, so local optimization is technically possible. No category dispatch adapter or golden result is retained, and REopt cannot supply a missing load profile, tariff, or technology design.
