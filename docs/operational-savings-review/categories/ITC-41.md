# Information Card — Efficient Fan or Ventilation System

**Retrofits included:** Efficient fan/blower replacement; Efficient ventilation system

**Overview:** An efficient fan, blower, or ventilation system reduces electric input while preserving required airflow and pressure.

**Broader Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings =
Annual Electricity Reduction × Bill-Derived Electricity Rate
```

**Expanded Formula**

```text
Annual Operational Savings = In-Scope Equipment Count × (Existing Input Power - Proposed Input Power) × Annual Operating Hours × Bill-Derived Electricity Rate

Input kW = Air Power kW / (Fan Efficiency × Motor Efficiency)
```

**■ Standard 1.1 — Efficient Fan or Ventilation System Annual Operating Hours**

**Purpose:**
Use U.S. Department of Energy reference buildings and U.S. Naval Observatory daylight data to resolve annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
U.S. Department of Energy - Commercial Reference Buildings

**Commercial Reference Buildings:**
[https://www.energy.gov/cmei/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings](https://www.energy.gov/cmei/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* Recognizable Business, Shift, Seasonal, or Usage Pattern
* Detailed Operating Days, Shifts, or Active Season, if known
* Measured Annual Operating Hours, if known
* Site Location and Business Activity

**Value Needed:**

* Annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance

**How to Use:**

1. Map the Efficient Fan or Ventilation System inputs to the documented Efficient Fan or Ventilation System Annual Operating Hours source fields or model inputs: Recognizable Business, Shift, Seasonal, or Usage Pattern; Detailed Operating Days, Shifts, or Active Season, if known; Measured Annual Operating Hours, if known; Site Location and Business Activity.
2. Route the stated pattern to a fixed-schedule or daylight method, apply all supplied days and seasonal details, validate the annual-hour result, and retain the method and analysis year.
3. When an exact value is unavailable, select one context-matched authoritative benchmark and then one deterministic RetroFi benchmark if needed; do not insert an unexplained cross-category default.
4. Return one selected annual operating hours, exact or estimated status, schedule formula, analysis year, uncertainty, and source provenance.
5. Retain the Efficient Fan or Ventilation System Annual Operating Hours source version, exact fields or model inputs, native units, eligible population, population size, selected-value rule, fallback level, selected record, and warnings.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Deterministic calendar calculation from a recognizable business, shift, seasonal, or usage pattern.
* **Automation Method:** Apply the supplied operating days, shifts, active weeks, holidays, and measured-hour overrides to a versioned local calendar calculation.
* **Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

**Validation:**
The DOE commercial reference-building schedule context was checked. Calendar arithmetic is deterministic when the operating pattern is complete, but a business label alone is not a validated annual-hours value and no category golden fixture exists.

**■ Standard 1.2 — Efficient Fan or Ventilation System Engineering Calculation**

**Purpose:**
Use U.S. Department of Energy - MEASUR to resolve existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings from the listed category inputs.

**Source:**
U.S. Department of Energy - MEASUR

**MEASUR tool and downloads:**

**Calculator list and descriptions:**

**ORNL MEASUR source repository:**
[https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Desktop](https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Desktop)

**Lookup Inputs:**

* In-Scope Equipment Count
* Required airflow from a nameplate, measurement, audit, or contractor specification
* Required pressure rise from a nameplate, measurement, audit, or contractor specification
* Existing Fan Nameplate or Test Information
* Existing Motor Nameplate or Test Information
* Proposed Fan Specifications
* Proposed Motor Specifications
* Annual operating hours from the connected schedule process

**Value Needed:**

* Existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings

**How to Use:**

1. Load the Efficient Fan or Ventilation System project facts from documented nameplates, measurements, controls trends, or contractor specifications and map their units to the MEASUR Fan System Assessment Tool.
2. When an exact technical input is unavailable, use one context-matched value selected from the closest authoritative equipment or application population before running the Fan System Assessment Tool; the simulator does not invent that input.
3. Run the pinned open-source Fan System Assessment Tool baseline and proposed cases using the category formula boundary shown in this card.
4. Return one selected existing and proposed annual resource use or avoided resource use, with calculator version, input units, and warnings.
5. Retain the MEASUR version, Fan System Assessment Tool input object, exact and benchmark input provenance, context filters, eligible populations, selection rules, unit conversions, warnings, and baseline and proposed outputs.

**Automation:**

* **Selected Strategy:** Pinned local execution of the MEASUR Fan System Assessment Tool for Efficient Fan or Ventilation System.
* **Automation Method:** Map reviewed project evidence into the Fan System Assessment Tool input schema, fill unresolved inputs through the single-value authoritative benchmark policy, execute the versioned local module, and preserve its warnings and native outputs.
* **Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

**Validation:**
The official MEASUR tool page, calculator descriptions, and open-source implementation were checked, so local automation is feasible. The exact category module, input and output mapping, and golden example have not yet been pinned, so this process must not imply executable validation.
