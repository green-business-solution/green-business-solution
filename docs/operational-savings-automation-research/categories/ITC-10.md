# ITC-10 - Refrigeration certified-rating replacement

This report evaluates automation coverage without changing the approved Information Card.
The category contains 3 category-local process instances and references 2 canonical Standards.
Its current formula, tree, bindings, ownership decisions, and status remain unchanged.

## Process coverage

## End-to-end graph

- `existing-product-rating`: Existing refrigeration equipment type or application [User] + Existing make and model, when available [User] + Existing capacity or size class [User] -> STD-DOE-CCMS-RATINGS + STD-ENERGY-STAR-PRODUCT-DATA -> equipment_products + equipment_certifications + equipment_performance_fields + source_releases + source_artifacts + energy_star_commercial_dishwashers + energy_star_dishwasher_operating_modes + product_taxonomy_crosswalks -> Existing annual electricity use per equipment unit -> existing_annual_kWh (kWh/unit-year)

## Feasibility

The category depends on these source-level verdicts: NOT_FEASIBLE_WITH_CURRENT_PUBLIC_SOURCES.
The process table reports the final proof level after execution-record verification, not a higher level that a manifest may have declared before the current run.
An exact path is usable only when every owned input is present and every Standard adapter returns one unambiguous compatible result.
A benchmark path is usable only where the category has a retained authoritative population and exact selection rule.
The runtime external-call count remains zero.

## Conditional next actions

| Process key | Current proof level | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| existing-product-rating | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Acquire or implement the missing evidence named by the blocker, then add exact adapter tests before claiming executable coverage. EXECUTION_RUN_RECORD_REQUIRED: The static proof declaration is not counted as executed proof until one current local content-bound run record covers every required exact test. |
| exact-proposed-product-rating | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Acquire or implement the missing evidence named by the blocker, then add exact adapter tests before claiming executable coverage. EXECUTION_RUN_RECORD_REQUIRED: The static proof declaration is not counted as executed proof until one current local content-bound run record covers every required exact test. |
| requirement-proposed-product-rating | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Acquire or implement the missing evidence named by the blocker, then add exact adapter tests before claiming executable coverage. EXECUTION_RUN_RECORD_REQUIRED: The static proof declaration is not counted as executed proof until one current local content-bound run record covers every required exact test. |
