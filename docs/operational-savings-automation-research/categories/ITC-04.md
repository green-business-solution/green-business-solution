# ITC-04 - Boiler control fractional fuel reduction

This report evaluates automation coverage without changing the approved Information Card.
The category contains 1 category-local process instance and references 1 canonical Standard.
Its current formula, tree, bindings, ownership decisions, and status remain unchanged.

## Process coverage

### Canonical process contract

| Process key | Process name | Canonical Standard | Required inputs | Exact output and formula term |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| doe_measur | Boiler Controls and Burner Improvements Engineering Calculation | STD-DOE-MEASUR | Boiler share of billed fuel [Bill]; Existing control sequence [Project Document]; Proposed control sequence [Project Document] | Baseline annual boiler fuel -> baseline_annual_fuel (therms/year; PER_YEAR); Proposed annual boiler fuel -> proposed_annual_fuel (therms/year; PER_YEAR) |

### Current execution evidence

| Process key | Execution-verified proof level | Adapter path | Actual adapter test result | Current blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| doe_measur | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | None implemented | None required or recorded for the current proof state | MISSING_PROOF_MANIFEST: No source-specific adapter proof manifest covers this canonical process. Missing gates: sourceIdentityPinned, artifactAcquired, checksumOrCommitRetained, schemaExtracted, requiredFieldsLocated, unitsEnumerationsPinned, parserOrModelExecuted, normalizedPublished, resolutionExecuted, standardOutputProduced, unitScopeMatches, formulaTermReached, offlineRerunPassed, provenanceComplete, mutationFailureTestsPassed. |

## End-to-end graph

- `doe_measur`: Boiler share of billed fuel [Bill] + Existing control sequence [Project Document] + Proposed control sequence [Project Document] -> STD-DOE-MEASUR -> model_versions + model_input_schemas + calculation_assumptions + calculation_runs + calculation_warnings -> Baseline annual boiler fuel -> baseline_annual_fuel (therms/year) + Proposed annual boiler fuel -> proposed_annual_fuel (therms/year)

## Feasibility

The category depends on these source-level verdicts: NOT_FEASIBLE_WITH_CURRENT_PUBLIC_SOURCES.
The process table reports the final proof level after execution-record verification, not a higher level that a manifest may have declared before the current run.
An exact path is usable only when every owned input is present and every Standard adapter returns one unambiguous compatible result.
A benchmark path is usable only where the category has a retained authoritative population and exact selection rule.
The runtime external-call count remains zero.

## Conditional next actions

| Process key | Current proof level | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| doe_measur | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Acquire or implement the missing evidence named by the blocker, then add exact adapter tests before claiming executable coverage. MISSING_PROOF_MANIFEST: No source-specific adapter proof manifest covers this canonical process. Missing gates: sourceIdentityPinned, artifactAcquired, checksumOrCommitRetained, schemaExtracted, requiredFieldsLocated, unitsEnumerationsPinned, parserOrModelExecuted, normalizedPublished, resolutionExecuted, standardOutputProduced, unitScopeMatches, formulaTermReached, offlineRerunPassed, provenanceComplete, mutationFailureTestsPassed. |
