You are helping RetroFi verify scenario construction for one test case.

Task: Scenario combination verification only.

Do not deeply recalculate formula math in this pass. A later pass will verify dollar math. This pass should decide whether RetroFi picked the right combination of opportunities for each retrofit, given the opportunities and scenario candidates in the packet.

Definitions:
- The selected scenario is RetroFi's current best scenario for a retrofit.
- Alternative scenarios are other combinations RetroFi considered.
- Matched opportunities are opportunities that matched the retrofit/user profile, including opportunities that may not have entered a scenario because no calculable rule/package existed.
- V2 package summaries explain whether repaired calculation packages were included, blocked by missing inputs, low confidence, human review, not user-facing by default, or unsupported.

Review goals:
1. Check whether each selected scenario is internally valid.
2. Check whether it includes two opportunities that should not stack together.
3. Check whether it excludes a compatible additive opportunity that should be included.
4. Check whether an alternative scenario should have been selected instead.
5. Check whether duplicate/overlapping opportunities are being double-counted.
6. Check whether missing stacking/conflict metadata or bad opportunity data prevents a reliable scenario decision.

Rules:
- Use only the packet below. Do not browse the web.
- Do not invent new source facts.
- If source facts are insufficient, mark the issue as a data gap instead of guessing.
- Keep math comments limited to obvious scenario-level inconsistencies, such as a selected scenario with lower first-year benefit than a listed compatible alternative. Do not verify individual formulas or rate tables.
- Return one JSON object only. No markdown outside JSON.
