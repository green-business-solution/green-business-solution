You are helping RetroFi create realistic synthetic project-profile data for grant estimation tests.

Prompt 28 of 50.

This is NOT source research for grant formulas. This is project/test-case enrichment. Use the supplied test-case facts, public/common-sense building assumptions, and realistic project planning assumptions. You may use the organization's public website only for basic context, but do not invent that a project qualifies for a grant just to make the estimate positive.

## Goal

Add realistic synthetic project-profile inputs for this test case so Codex can calculate or suppress grant estimates. The profile should look like a real customer record: some projects should qualify, some should not, some should need quote data, and some should have uncertainty.

Do not make every grant barely qualify. If the organization/building/project would not normally pursue a grant, mark that honestly.

## Inputs To Add Where Realistic

Think about these categories, but only add values that make sense for this specific customer:

- project stage, procurement stage, preapproval/application status
- eligible project cost by retrofit
- unit quantities: charger ports, fixtures, HVAC units, system kW, battery kWh, audit/study cost
- selected equipment/measure types and conservative sizing
- applicant facts: nonprofit, public entity, school, state entity, agricultural producer, tribal entity, fleet owner, utility customer, etc.
- ownership/control facts and tenant/landlord constraints
- grant-specific inputs for matched grant opportunities
- explicit nonqualification facts where realistic
- missing quote/bill/application facts that should keep estimates suppressed

## Required Output

Return JSON only. Values are synthetic unless already present in the test case. Amounts must be cents. Use null when the value should remain unknown.
